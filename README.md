functional video player need some fixes thats all


so you wondering how this works?
there is a time and sound slider so it WORKS next the download button... you press it dialog window pops you paste your favorite video link on yt  there and press Insert .. there is cluster
download but it doesnt work atm its supposed to add more input bars so you can download up to 10 videos at a time (YES) so there is autoplay too and it does what it says
calling the function mediaplayer.play() every 0.5 sec i think so its defenitly not Loop its Autoplay. THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW...
